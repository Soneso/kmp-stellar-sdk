/**
 * Builder for constructing [SorobanTransactionDataXdr] structures.
 *
 * SorobanTransactionData contains the resource footprint and fee information required
 * for Soroban smart contract transactions. This builder provides a fluent API for
 * constructing and modifying these structures.
 *
 * ## Use Cases
 *
 * This builder is particularly useful for:
 * - Building [com.soneso.stellar.sdk.operations.ExtendFootprintTTLOperation] transactions
 * - Building [com.soneso.stellar.sdk.operations.RestoreFootprintOperation] transactions
 * - Manually constructing transaction footprints for testing
 * - Modifying simulation results before transaction submission
 *
 * For most Soroban transactions, you should use [SorobanServer.prepareTransaction] which
 * automatically populates the SorobanTransactionData from simulation results.
 *
 * ## Structure
 *
 * SorobanTransactionData consists of:
 * - **Resource Fee**: Additional fee for resource consumption (beyond base transaction fee)
 * - **Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage metrics
 *   - CPU Instructions: Number of WASM instructions to execute
 *   - Disk Read Bytes: Bytes read from ledger storage
 *   - Write Bytes: Bytes written to ledger storage and memory
 * - **Footprint**: Ledger keys accessed by the transaction
 *   - Read-Only: Keys read but not modified
 *   - Read-Write: Keys both read and modified
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Start with empty data
 * val builder = SorobanDataBuilder()
 *     .setResourceFee(50000)
 *     .setResources(SorobanDataBuilder.Resources(
 *         cpuInstructions = 1000000,
 *         diskReadBytes = 5000,
 *         writeBytes = 2000
 *     ))
 *     .setReadOnly(listOf(ledgerKey1))
 *     .setReadWrite(listOf(ledgerKey2))
 *
 * val sorobanData = builder.build()
 * ```
 *
 * ## From Simulation Results
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Start with simulation results
 * val simulation = server.simulateTransaction(tx)
 * val builder = SorobanDataBuilder(simulation.transactionData!!)
 *     .setResourceFee(simulation.minResourceFee!! + 10000) // Add buffer
 *
 * val sorobanData = builder.build()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Modifying Existing Data
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Modify existing soroban data
 * val updated = SorobanDataBuilder(transaction.sorobanData!!)
 *     .setReadWrite(listOf(additionalKey)) // Replace read-write keys
 *     .build()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Immutability
 *
 * The builder uses defensive copying to ensure immutability:
 * - Each setter returns a new builder instance
 * - The [build] method returns a deep copy of the data
 * - Original data structures are never mutated
 *
 * @see SorobanServer.prepareTransaction
 * @see com.soneso.stellar.sdk.operations.ExtendFootprintTTLOperation
