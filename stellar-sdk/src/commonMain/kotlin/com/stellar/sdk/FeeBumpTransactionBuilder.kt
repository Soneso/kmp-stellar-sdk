/**
 * Builder for constructing [FeeBumpTransaction] instances.
 *
 * This builder provides a fluent API for creating fee bump transactions that wrap existing
 * transactions with higher fees. Fee bumps are useful when network congestion causes
 * transactions to get stuck in the queue.
 *
 * ## Usage with Base Fee (Recommended)
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val feeBump = FeeBumpTransactionBuilder(originalTransaction)
 *     .setFeeSource("GFEE...")
 *     .setBaseFee(1000)  // Fee per operation
 *     .build()
 *
 * feeBump.sign(feeSourceKeypair)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Usage with Exact Fee
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val feeBump = FeeBumpTransactionBuilder(originalTransaction)
 *     .setFeeSource("GFEE...")
 *     .setFee(10000)  // Total fee
 *     .build()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Important Notes
 *
 * - You must specify EITHER [setBaseFee] OR [setFee], not both
 * - The fee source account must sign the fee bump transaction
 * - The inner transaction must already be signed by its source account
 * - Fee bumps can only wrap regular transactions, not other fee bumps
 *
 * @property innerTransaction The transaction to wrap with a higher fee
 *
 * @see FeeBumpTransaction
 * @see <a href="https://developers.stellar.org/docs/encyclopedia/fee-bump-transactions">Fee-bump Transactions</a>
