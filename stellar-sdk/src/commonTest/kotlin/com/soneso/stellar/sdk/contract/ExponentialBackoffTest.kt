/**
 * Comprehensive tests for the exponential backoff helper function used in AssembledTransaction.
 *
 * The withExponentialBackoff function implements polling with exponential backoff:
 * - Calls the function immediately (first attempt)
 * - If condition is met on first attempt, returns immediately
 * - Otherwise, enters polling loop with exponential backoff
 * - Wait times: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, 60s (max)
 * - Returns all attempts made before timeout or condition met
 *
 * Tests verify:
 * - Immediate success (no retries)
 * - Single retry behavior
 * - Multiple retries with proper timing
 * - Timeout enforcement
 * - Exponential backoff doubling
 * - Max wait cap at 60 seconds
 * - All attempts are collected and returned
 * - Edge cases (short/long timeouts, never-true conditions)
